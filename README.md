# CloudAttend

CloudAttend helps you record attendance with RFID and Google Sheets. Tap a card to check in or check out; the device shows status on an LCD and writes to the cloud.

## Philosophy Behind the Project

Pause and read

> “There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages.”

There are many projects built with the same components — ESP8266, RFID, and LCD — but what makes **CloudAttend** different is not just _what_ components are used, but _how_ they’re connected and designed to work together.
The **system architecture**, **data flow**, and **integration approach** bring a new perspective on how these modules can create a seamless and cloud-connected attendance system.

## Beyond v0.1

- **Migrate to a proper database** such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for reliability and scalability.
- **Adopt a modern frontend framework** like **Bootstrap** or **React** to improve UI consistency and responsiveness.
- **Implement authentication** on the dashboard (admin / teacher login) to secure attendance data.
- **Add mobile-friendly PWA (Progressive Web App)** support for quick access and offline viewing.
- **Integrate notifications** — email or Telegram alerts when attendance is marked or unusual patterns are detected.
